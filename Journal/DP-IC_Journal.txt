	We tried to get the sprite sheet to work but could not because I was looking at JavaScript code instead
of Java code. I didn't notice until a week later.

	We got the menu to work and switch through the different panels through button pressing, and got an image
 to appear behind the image.

	We got our monster to follow the character around, and change oriantation depending on what side the
character was on.

	We got our Ai to work into the game, and changed the monster we had into a pet duck.
We also got the Github to work, and made animations for the duck. We are struggling to figure out how to get the
menu to work by pressing the "esc" button in our game.
